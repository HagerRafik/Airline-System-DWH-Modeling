# Airline-System-DWH-Modeling
### Project Description
A major airline company decided to hire you to assist the executive management to analyze
their current business processes and expand the company by discovering new opportunities.
Executives decided that the first deliverable should focus on the flight activity to ensure good
ongoing business process.
The marketing department wants to analyze what flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers take,
what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade, how they earn and redeem their frequent
flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions, how long their overnight stays
are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum, aluminum, or titanium
status.
Your analysis shall also include the reservation process where finance team will be interested in
analyzing the company profit. Note that reservation processes can take place through multiple
channels.
Airline company also provides customer care interaction before, within and after your trip to
handle customer inquiries, complaints and keep their feedback for business enhancements.
Analysis should include interaction type and problem severity (if issue exists)
Apply dimensional modeling process to design the logical and physical design to support such
kind of analysis for decision support
